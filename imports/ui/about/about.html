        <h3 class="ui large header">How?</h3>
        <p class="text">Besides a handful of simmered creativity and concentrated effort,
          this site runs on a bunch of cool web technologies including <b>Meteor, MongoDB, Blaze, and Semantic UI</b>.
          Lovely is owned by Joey Muller (<a href="https://github.com/jmullercuber">@jmullercuber</a>) and maintained as a side project.
          But because it's really about sharing with the community, the codebase for this site is open source.
          So whether you're a seasoned coder or a spicy artist, you can make Lovely better with your contributions.
          Consider yourself encouraged to write the next chapter of a delicious history.</p>
